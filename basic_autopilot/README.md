#Basic Autopilot with tensorflow

This is a variation of Sully Chen's autopilot model with a few changed hyperparameters. This model is originally based on a project made by the NVIDIA team ( link below )

Nvidia link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf

The model uses CNN with a 3 layer approach to convert images to the predicted steering angle

#WARNING : This is a very rudimentary model that should not be used to automate the car in any case. This is only to better understand how CNN's work and how a basic self driving may work.

If you would like to use your own test data to train the model, you may do so by changing the data path in model.py
